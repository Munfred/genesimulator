# Bistable promoter, pausing, footprint capabilities
# 
# This version adds:
# - Bistable promoter which can switch between ON/OFF states
# - Polymerasees can go into paused state
# - Polymerase now have footprints in bp
# 
# The simulation now is considerably longer and matplotlib cant handle large matrices well, so the simulator outputs a CSV file with gene occupancy and a txt file with other parameters instead of plotting them.
# 
# Some examples of biological rates:
# 
# Footprint of 30 base pairs
# 
# B = 0.5            polymerase binding rate on the ON state (zero for OFF state)
# r = 80               elongation rate after first escape step
# k_off = 0.2       rate at which the an OFF promoter goes to the ON state
# k_on = 0.5       rate at which the an ON promoter goes to the OFF state
# k_p- = 4           rate for an paused polymerase exit the paused state
# k_p+ = 0.01     rate at which an elongating  polymerase goes to the paused state
